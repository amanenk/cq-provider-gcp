# Table: gcp_compute_url_maps
Represents a URL Map resource  Google Compute Engine has two URL Map resources:  * Global (/compute/docs/reference/rest/{$api_version}/urlMaps) * Regional (/compute/docs/reference/rest/{$api_version}/regionUrlMaps)  A URL map resource is a component of certain types of GCP load balancers and Traffic Director  * urlMaps are used by external HTTP(S) load balancers and Traffic Director * regionUrlMaps are used by internal HTTP(S) load balancers  For a list of supported URL map features by load balancer type, see the  Load balancing features: Routing and traffic management table  For a list of supported URL map features for Traffic Director, see the  Traffic Director features: Routing and traffic management table  This resource defines mappings from host names and URL paths to either a backend service or a backend bucket  To use the global urlMaps resource, the backend service must have a loadBalancingScheme of either EXTERNAL or INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED To use the regionUrlMaps resource, the backend service must have a loadBalancingScheme of INTERNAL_MANAGED For more information, read URL Map Concepts
