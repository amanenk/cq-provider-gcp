|default_route_action_retry_policy_retry_conditions|text[]|Specfies one or more conditions when this retry rule applies Valid values are: - 5xx: Loadbalancer will attempt a retry if the backend service responds with any 5xx response code, or if the backend service does not respond at all, example: disconnects, reset, read timeout, connection failure, and refused streams - gateway-error: Similar to 5xx, but only applies to response codes 502, 503 or 504 - - connect-failure: Loadbalancer will retry on failures connecting to backend services, for example due to connection timeouts - retriable-4xx: Loadbalancer will retry for retriable 4xx response codes Currently the only retriable error supported is 409 - refused-stream:Loadbalancer will retry if the backend service resets the stream with a REFUSED_STREAM error code This reset type indicates that it is safe to retry|
